# CasperJS Frontend Tests

[CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/) is navigation scripting & testing for PhantomJS and SlimerJS.

## Magento

This [test suite](https://github.com/magento-hackathon/hackathon-casperjs) was developed during various Magento hackathons in Germany. The tests located in the tests directory work with a default Magento CE installation with sample data installed. The idea is that if you have a custom project you will duplicate those tests in a separate directory and make the necessary adjustments so that the tests pass with your custom theme, extensions and custom modifications.

## WordPress/WooCommerce

T.J. Fogarty put up a [gist](https://gist.github.com/tjFogarty/46a6bc231dbebe925728) for testing a WordPress search form with CasperJS, which might be a good start for more tests. This search test was adapted for the Twenty Sixteen theme with German language.

## osCommerce

At Openstream we're maintaining a couple of legacy projects based on osCommerce 2.2, so we might also need some tests for those projects.

Code is poetry.
